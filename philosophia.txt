Computation is the extension of the human mind. It is the final frontier. To be here and research on computing topics make me solemn 
and content. To be is to do and we shall.
Alan Turing problem of whether computer can think has led to the development of the field of aritificial intelligence. The most 
important idea occurred in the field is ANN (artificial neural network). all known AI models are enhancements or extensions to ANN model.
----------------------------------------------------------------
the fundamental of computation initiated by the following questions:
LO: what is A computer --------> theory of computation
L1: how to built a computer  ------------> computer architecture
L2: how does a machine computes ------> algorithms
L3: how to communicate with a machine ----------> programming language
L4: how to share file from one node to another ------> network
---------------------------------------------------------------------
These are currently open research areas in the field:
[1] I-POST: use of machine vision for commerce*
[2] BOLD: bayesian online liar detection**
[4] INS project
[5] happy birthday attack 
[6] snap app
[7] ping pong: cmd prompt wth AI player
[8] electric lighter
[9] Project-Firnas
[10] Project-GlassFinance
