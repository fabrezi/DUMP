Computation is the extension of the human mind. It is the final frontier. To be here and research on computing topics make me solemn 
and content. To be is to do and we shall.
Alan Turing problem of whether computer can think has led to the development of the field of aritificial intelligence. The most 
important idea occurred in the field is ANN (artificial neural network). all known AI models are enhancements or extensions to ANN model.
#the initial questions that led to the notion of computation were as such: calculate the root of polynomial equation, 
#the task at hand is to become a competent software engineer. maybe an all-star one day. it is a long journey. but every dream 
starts at some place. my does here. sitting in a small room. tiny room. A software engineer is a person who makes software or maintains them. Software are computer programs that run on top of operating systems. It is new engineering which has effected our world tremendously. Software will eat the world and i want a chunk of the meal. My training has been to understand and built software. So lets be. 
#You must first focus on the fundamentals. Any thing that needs to be mastered must start from the roots. Else you be lost. 
Focus on the fundamental of computation. Learn to code effectively. then you can move on to advance areas, such as: 
machine learning. 
#Bootcamp Train: Goal: SE
- Architecture - Java (Programming Priniciple) - Algorithms (6.006) - Network - ML.
# Computer Abstraction and technology
# assembly language, logic design
- Java Programming
- Snappo <use it, open-source>
- Algorithm <mighty book>
----------------------------------------------------------------
the fundamental of computation initiated by the following questions:
LO: what is A computer --------> theory of computation
L1: how to built a computer  ------------> computer architecture
L2: how does a machine computes ------> algorithms
L3: how to communicate with a machine ----------> programming language
L4: how to share file from one node to another ------> network
---------------------------------------------------------------------
These are currently open research areas in the field:
[1] I-POST: use of machine vision for commerce*
[2] BOLD: bayesian online liar detection**
[4] INS project
[5] happy birthday attack 
[6] snap app
[7] ping pong: cmd prompt wth AI player
[8] electric lighter
[9] Project-Firnas
[10] Project-GlassFinance

Q. How do you write a conference paper?
A. the following are the portions which makes a conference paper:

1. what is the problem statement. what is the problem that you are trying to solve. write in detail.
2. prior- solution
3. Solution porposal - create a solution that you think will be able to tackle (1). use imagination. architecture. software kit
4. algorithm - this is tricky but you must create a good alg. 
5. mathematical formulation
6. Implementation - code, graph, data process, performance chart
7. conclusion - future work, conclude, references
----------------------------------------------------------
Skills for B.E:
